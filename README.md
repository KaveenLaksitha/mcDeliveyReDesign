## About

McDelivery Sri Lanka is an e-commerce mobile application that has been developed to facilitate the online food home delivery of McDonald's fast-food system in Sri Lanka. Specifically, during the pandemic period, the targeted customer sector is facilitated and encouraged to make use of this mobile application to make online orders whenever required, the payments for such orders can also be settled through the application itself. Since the application is supported by McDonaldâ€™s itself the security of the application is maintained.
Thereby through methodical research, we hope to identify the key points that have caused the User Experience within this to lack, specifically, the bugs associated with function flow, the interface issues, currently lacking functions, upgrades required for available functions, currently available, yet not needed functions and issues related to the attractiveness of the application.
The research is majorly conducted via contextual inquiry and thus collected data will be used to confirm and highlight the key usability issues, identify the approach that could resolve the issues. Accordingly, we will try to provide solutions to the issues of the application and improve User Experience by redesigning the application according to the exact requirements of the customer. Then improve the quality of the user interfaces, user flow experience, and navigation paths.
